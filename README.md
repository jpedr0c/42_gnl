## üí° About the project
> The function takes a file descriptor as a parameter and returns a line from the file associated with that descriptor. The function reads the file line by line until the end of the file is reached, or until a newline character is encountered.


## üìù About function

### Function signature
```c
int get_next_line(int fd);
```

### Parameter
- `fd` -> The file descriptor of the file to read.

### Return value
- Return `1` if a line has been read successfully.
- Return `0` if the end of the file has been reached.
- Return `-1` if an error occurs.

### Limitations
> The function has a buffer size of `BUFFER_SIZE`, which is defined in the `get_next_line.h` header file. If a line is longer than `BUFFER_SIZE`, the function will read the line multiple iterations. It's also not thread safe, so it shouldn't be used in a multithreaded proper synchronization.
